## Method

The basic idea is to utilize the page of <a href="https://www.kollerauktionen.ch/en/auctioncalendar-archive.htm">Results & Catalogues past sales</a>, go to Online catalogue of each category and mimic scroll down in browser to retrieve all the sales, then redirect to each page to scrape the detailed sale information. Selenium is used to mimic the scroll behavior here. All the detailed information of the sales are preserved, and can be further parsed into more data columns based on requirement. Here just use data from catalogue of 19th-century-paintings-8 for demonstration, would update once have all the data.
